# Companys_profit_pred_model
A Python implementation of Multiple Linear Regression using the 50_Startups dataset. This project covers data preprocessing, categorical encoding, model training, and predictions. Ideal for beginners learning regression and feature engineering in machine learning.

# 📊 Multiple Linear Regression – 50_Startups Dataset

This project demonstrates how to build a **Multiple Linear Regression** model using Python and scikit-learn. We use the real-world `50_Startups.csv` dataset to predict company profits based on R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Dataset:** 50_Startups.csv
- **Goal:** Predict startup profit based on multiple features
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Categorical data encoding (One-Hot Encoding)
  - Feature selection
  - Model training & prediction
  - Model evaluation

## 📁 Files

- `50_Startups.csv` – Dataset file
- `multiple_linear_regression.py` – Python script for the full workflow

## 🧠 Workflow

1. Import libraries and load the dataset
2. Encode the categorical "State" column
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
4. Train a `LinearRegression` model
5. Predict and compare results

## 📊 Output Sample

[[103015.2 103282.38]
[132582.3 144259.4 ]


Each row compares the **predicted** vs **actual** profit values.

## 💡 Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repo
2. Make sure `50_Startups.csv` is in the same directory
3. Run the script:


```bash
python multiple_linear_regression.py
```
